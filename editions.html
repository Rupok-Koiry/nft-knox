                A publication known as the Glasgow Looking Glass by William
                Heath begins in Scotland. Referred to as a form of topical
                graphic journalism, the satirical nature of the text combined
                with the animated illustrations leads to it being generally
                credited as the inspiration for comics.

                Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Topffer creates Histoire de M. Vieux
                Bois as what he describes as a ‘diversion’ for friends. The
                work, however, gains immense popularity and is published in
                Switzerland in 1837 before being translated and recreated across
                the world. The paneled format of the work is an accepted
                influence for later works such as newspaper comic strips.

                A weekly publication known as Punch, or The London Charivari,
                begins production through Henry Mayhew and Ebenezer Landells.
                The British magazine redefines the word ‘cartoon’ to be
                associated with humorous artwork. Its dramatic success leads to
                circulation hitting a peak a century later in the 1940s.

                Topffer’s Histoire de M. Vieux Bois goes through multiple
                iterations. Eventually, it is translated into English,
                re-illustrated, and published by the Brother Jonathan newspaper
                in New York in 1842. The end result of The Adventures of Mr.
                Obadiah Oldbuck is now considered to be the first American
                comic.

                Reproductions of European works continue to gain attention from
                artists as a new medium. However, these often unauthorized
                reproductions and translations dominate the medium until 1849.
                At that time, J.A. and D.F. Read create what is thought to be
                the first uniquely American comic - Journey to the Gold Diggins
                by Jeremiah Saddlebags.

                Originally proposed in German by Austrian cartoonist Joseph
                Keppler, Puck is the first successful humor magazine in the US.
                Content within it largely mirrors the political and societal
                satire of Punch in the UK. The English language version is first
                circulated in 1877 after German versions fail to gain adoption
                or backing. Involved artists go on to found the satirical
                magazine Judge in 1881.

                Publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Hearst compete for sales
                of their respective newspapers. Eventually, each introduces
                color comic strips as a way to increase circulation. The Yellow
                Kid character becomes the most notable of the time from Richard
                Outcault’s Hogan’s Alley comic strip starting in 1896. His use
                of a speech balloon is thought to be the first of its kind.

                Rudolph Dirks’ comic strip The KatzenJammer Kids first appears
                in the American Humorist. The paneled approach harkens back to
                earlier works such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois and starts to
                feature what some consider a more traditional comic cartoon
                style. The same year, The Yellow Kid in McFadden’s Flats
                introduces the character outside of newspapers and its back
                cover bears the now iconic phrase ‘comic book.’

                regular publication separate from that of magazines or
                newspapers, and leads to others such as The Funnies in 1929 and
                Detective Dan, Secret Operative No. 48 in 1933. Funnies on
                Parade also in 1933 is the first publication in the now standard

                by its sister company Detective Comics in 1938, rebranding as DC

                copy selling for over $3.2M in 2014. Detective Comics introduces

                audiences such as Richie Rich or Little Dot gain popularity, the
                ‘Silver Age’ moniker is derived from fans commenting on the
                second wave of transcendent superhero characters.

                Rebranded Marvel Comics begins a stretch of character
                introductions unparalleled in popularity. Fantastic Four #1 is
                followed by powerhouse franchises such as The Incredible Hulk
                (1962), Spider-Man in Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962), and the X-Men
                (1963). A new style of incorporating science fiction and more
                complicated personalities proves wildly successful. Artwork
                associated with this time period starts to break from previous
                eras, mirroring the creativity of the time.

                Black Panther is introduced in Marvel Comics’ Fantastic Four #52
                as a prime example of unabashed social commentary. The Batman
                television series commences a popular three year run.

                discussion, becoming more culturally significant and less a

                The publication of Conan the Barbarian #1 heralds a new interest
                of science fiction and fantasy in comics. Deeper storytelling
                rather than dramatic introductions and events become more the
                norm, often with a darker side. A maturing audience out of the
                Silver Age brought the opportunity to show a mature Green
                Lantern in the same year, addressing drug use on its cover.
                Regulation is laxed to allow ‘vampires, ghouls, and werewolves’
                provided they are done so in the ‘classic tradition.’

                - Gwen Stacy is murdered in Amazing Spider-Man #121, the seminal
                moment of the Bronze Era. Despite comics darkening in previous
                years, this event carries content over a threshold into a new
                approach and feel. Creativity abounds and the number of titles
                expands rapidly. A large part of expansion is that of DC Comics
                in an attempt to regain market share lost to Marvel Comics.

                DC Comics ceases production on a number of characters in what is
                termed the ‘DC Implosion.’ The rapid expansion of content
                combined with lower sales creates an untenable situation for the

                with only 35 copies said to be printed.

                Many new independent publishers start producing content, a trend
                that began during the Bronze Age and was helped by the industry
                shakeup of the DC Implosion. Continuing the trend of dark
                content is Crisis on Infinite Earths. The series contains scores
                of deaths including that of popular characters previously known
                as Supergirl and the Flash. Speculation runs hot as collectors
                look to purchase comics as an investment.

                Different issues of the same comics become popular due to the
                speculation, leading to ‘variants’ in publication. X-Men #1
                becomes the clearest example of this trend with five different
                variants in addition to holographic covers. The record setting
                8M+ copies sold leaves collectors to question value when
                scarcity doesn’t exist.

                A group of Marvel employees agree to leave the company and found
                Image Comics. The biggest reason for the ‘X-odus’ (stylized due
                to artists involved in the X-Men franchise) is the idea that
                copyrights would be kept with the creators, finalizing the trend
                of independent comic creation. Spawn #1 is the first major
                success through the new production.

                Dark characters and content are now the norm. Daredevil,
                Elektra, and the Punisher all have publications of their own
                highlighting their considerably flawed personalities and
                behavior. Marvel initiates the first solo comic for Venom with
                Lethal Protector #1. Most notably in the same year DC Comics
                releases Superman vol. 2 #75 - The Death of Superman.

                Certified Guaranty Company (CGC) is formed as a way to address
                the inability to verify the quality of comic books. As
                speculative buying has been in place for many years, the absence
                of an authority on the condition is apparent. CGC’s services of
                identifying an authentic work, recognizing a ‘restored’ work,
                and giving a score correlated to condition becomes the standard
                for comic ownership and investment. Comic Book Certification
                Services (CBCS) is later founded by CGC’s primary grading
                expert, firmly implanting the certification process as a
                must-have in collecting.

                Marvel starts the trend of large scale comic book story adoption
                by the film industry. Cultural significance is now at its peak
                with characters featured from every Age of comics. The same year
                the independent comic Kick-Ass is published, which is also made
                into a film series. The publication is yet another result of the
                X-odus, as Marvel creates the offshoot known as Icon Comics in
                2004 for creators to own their content as a retention move.
