              </div>
              <p>
                NFT Knox was founded on the concept of utility, bridging
                blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to link
                real-world assets with digital representations. At its core, NFT
                Knox securely stores high-value, real-world assets and
                permanently ties each asset to a transferable and redeemable
                NFT. Our service uniquely leverages blockchain to unlock
                highly-liquid transactions on traditionally slow-churn,
                high-friction product categories.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the primary focus of NFTs to date has been on novelty
                digital art, our technology scales NFT technology to accommodate
                any number of physical items - for example, graded collectibles,
                commissioned paintings, or even high-end valuables. Traditional
                transactions on real-world assets involve real risk. Damage,
                theft, authentication, and insurance can be costly and incur
                transaction time due to shipping. With NFT Knox, conducting
                transactions on authenticated, secure real-world assets is as
                simple and rapid as sending an email.
              </p>

                <h2>ASSET-BACKED NFTs</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                At NFT Knox’s core is the concept of utility: correlation of a
                physical asset with a digital representation contains immense
                value. An NFT is a clear answer to how to represent that
                physical asset. An NFT’s unique digital address, combined with
                blockchain’s consensus-based ledger, provide a technology that
                ensures the stable digital representation of a client’s physical
                asset.
              </p>
              <div class="row gx-5 align-items-center mt-5">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>
                    NFT technology brings the power of innovation and creation
                    to digitally speak for any real-world element. The publicity
                    of the metaverse should not be solely related to the
                    benefits of a digital world … the connection between it and
                    real life is where the real excitement lies. NFT Knox is
                    spearheading technology allowing clients to access valuables
                    in both spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NFT Knox enables consensus verification of NFT ownership
                    through the minting process, which allows the mirroring of a
                    physical collectible or asset in digital format. This
                    consensus is accomplished by (at minimum) memorializing a
                    high-resolution video or image of the possession in question
                    on the chain, and the immutable record is what verifies
                    ownership rather than any singular entity granting that
                    authority

                The physical assets that NFT Knox hold have a combination of
                emotional, financial, or sentimental importance, and the
                security and insurance procedures we have in place match that
                significance.

                    NFT Knox understands the storage of an asset must ensure
                    preservation. Equally as important, the trust in our storage
                    process must be unwavering and transparent. We store assets
                    in temperature-, humidity-, and UV-protected conditions with
                    both active and passive fire protection measures in place.
                    We have also enhanced the security associated with these
                    measures as an additional layer of protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our facilities have 24-hour monitoring and redundant
                    security systems in place to ensure the physical security of
                    our assets. While we don’t disclose the precise location of
                    our secured assets, NFT Knox does participate in routine,
                    transparent 3rd-party audits of our entire inventory to
                    maintain the confidence of our clients.

                    The assets in our possession are fully insured should the
                    impossible happen. We have guaranteed the asset’s value for
                    as long as we are responsible for its preservation.

              </div>
              <p>
                By design, secure storage of physical assets in the NFT Knox
                vault limits our clients’ access to their assets. As such, we
                provide a mechanism for clients to retain some tactile, physical
                representation of their asset in the NFT Knox vault – we created
                NFT Knox PROOFS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building on NFT Knox PROOFS, we have also developed a warranted
                document verifying ownership of the asset in question for
                copyrighted items. We offer these NFT Knox CERTIFIED PROOFS to
                each collector or individual as part of our purchasing process.
              </p>
              <p>
                NFT Knox PROOFS offer a stunning visual presentation for our
                client assets that lack copyright complications. We offer NFT
                Knox PROOFS through our platform at the owner's preference, from
                the most basic representation to a near indistinguishable
                replica.

                    At any time, the sole owner of an Asset-Backed NFT can
                    redeem the physical asset. NFT Knox's process for validating
                    the owner’s physical mailed address, as documented in this
                    whitepaper, gives all parties transparency as to where the
                    asset will ultimately reside should an asset redemption be
                    triggered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A redemption operation is simple. The owner initiates the
                    process by transferring their NFT to the NFT Knox redemption
                    wallet and NFT Knox cryptodiagramically verifies the
                    integrity of the owner-submitted mailing address. For added
                    security, an email requesting the completion of that same
                    signature process ensures an up-to-date mailing address for
                    the pending redemption
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon completion of any successful redemption process, the
                    NFT associated with the redeemed asset is burned (destroyed)
                    through our automated process. The creation of a newly
                    minted NFT would occur should the owner who redeemed the
                    asset wish to re-introduce it into the NFT Knox platform,
                    ship it to one of our facilities, and restart the cycle.

                On subsequent sales, while the asset remains in NFT Knox’s

                each transaction and awarded to the original minting owner as
                well as NFT Knox. This is once again in addition to a 2.5%

                The NFT Knox platform is a one-of-a-kind solution for
                versatility, scalability, and connecting NFTs to tangible
                assets. In addition, its modular structure enables the smooth
                integration of blockchain technology and the implementation of
                third-party NFT marketplaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our current web-based platform consists of two core components
                1) a backend framework using Python, commercial cloud services,
                and API integration; 2) a frontend written in HTML, CSS, and
                Javascript. Integral to our frontend is our signature process,
                which interfaces with MetaMask to digitally sign and register
                ownership to the NFT and asset. This digital signature is a
                critical component to our verification and redemption process.
              </p>

                NFT Knox is not trying to operate simply in the digital space.
                We aim to connect a variety of physical asset classes with
                digital representations – to both improve authenticity and
                streamline the buying & selling of high-friction physical
                assets. We believe NFT Knox Asset-Backed NFT represent a sea
                change for NFTs and are among the first real-world use-case for
                NFT technology.

              <p class="mb-5">
                NFT Knox starts the Asset-Backed NFT concept with a collectible
                set of comic books. Later editions issued will include other
                collectibles such as trading cards and action figures. Further
                development includes the NFT Knox Portfolio feature, where a
                collector has the ability to track their collection’s value in
                real time. Collectors will also use this feature to sort their
                collection by type of collectible.
